# reflections

Attached are the reflections assignments from Udacity's GitHub course. These assignments consist of prompts which are used to track and record progress. They're very helpful in terms of producing a written record for review; I had to take a about 2 weeks away from the course due to work and life responsibilities and was able to pick back up without any problem due to the information I left in my reflections. I've posted them here mostly as an exercise to ensure I know how to push repositories to GitHub, but feel free to browse and change stuff around. Any feedback or interaction with a repository is helpful for me as I'm learning how to interact with GitHub.
